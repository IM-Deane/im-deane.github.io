## II. Analysis & Design

I've been commissioned to redesign TCA's existing website. My plan is to
modernize the site using mobile-first principles.

### Problems:

1. Styling and layout

The site layout is structured using <table> elements. This has created a
disappointing experience for mobile users.

The overall theme of the site is rather bland. Most of the images look generic
and do not convey a meaningful message. The color scheme needs an update. The
logo looks date and should be modernized.

Some of the links are broken and lead to an Adobe flash player error.

The navigation bar is currently oriented vertically. I would like it to be
displayed more prominently throughout the site.

The buttons are very confusing and don't standout. In fact I did not realize
they were buttons when I first visted the site. On first glance they do not look
interactive which creates a confusing experience. Users should not have to work
to access the site's content.

A site footer with copyright and social media links should be added.

2. Content

The entire websites content needs to be overhauled.

I. **Home:** Bland and should be completely overhauled.

**Solution:**

Create stacked sections that provide an overview of the other pages. Potentially
add a testimonial section at the bottom.

II. **About us:** Text is small and hard to read. Also contains a lot of
outdated information.

**Solution:**

Revamp the style and update the information.

III. **Services:** Add sections that offer a better description of the services
TCA provides.

**Solution:**

Provide more details about TCA's best services. Have smaller list that includes
the company's other services.

IV. **Clients:** page simply lists TCA's past clients and partnerships.

**Solution:**

Update the listing and perhaps include company logos. May just delete or combine
with the projects page.

V. Gallery page does not convey any information about past projects other than a
title and image of the clients name. Furthermore, all of the links on this page
are broken and throw an Adobe flash error.

**Solution:**

Convert page into a "projects" page that provides an overview of past jobs.

Clicking a job image should lead to another page that displays more information
about the specified job.

Some of this information should include:

- More pictures of the job site
- Clients name
- Job date
- Location
- Perhaps the category type of the job (ie. "commerical" or "hospital")
- Brief over of the job site and description of the work done by TCA.

The bottom of the page could include a "Related Projects" section that displays
additional projects (like Amazon related products).

VI. **Careers:** should contain more persuasive copy and also include a form.

**Solution:** Add a form that links to the hiring managers e-mail.

VII. **Contact:** only displays information and should be converted to a form.

**Solution:** Add a contact form that links to the company e-mail. This page
should also emphasis that job quote requests should go here.
